How to make this site?

How to make this site?
Play around with the content...

Is it worth it? 
It should be, if nothing else it's:
1. A good experiment
2. A new experience that will be useful in some other effort
3. A good use of my time
4. A venture into affiliate business model

...so why not? Time will pass one way or another, at least doing this I can have a head start if a black swan appears.


How far can I get with it?
I'm not sure, but it doesn't matter anyway. It's important I'm doing sth new that has real money making potential.
Also, it's important to note that this is just an experiment, a little project, it's just a seed of something that might be a big deal one day.
